# The Riddle

100 prisoners are each given a number from 1 to 100.

Each prisoner is placed in a separate room, and each room contains a box with all 100 numbers in it.

The prisoners are allowed to view the boxes in the following manner: each prisoner can open up to 50 boxes.

If a prisoner finds their own number in one of the boxes they open, they will be freed.

If every prisoner finds their own number, all the prisoners are freed.

If any prisoner fails to find their own number, all the prisoners are executed.

**The Question**: What strategy should the prisoners use to maximize their chances of survival?
